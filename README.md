Gradebook and Assessment Management System

Problem: Teachers likely manage grades and assessments using a combination of tools or even spreadsheets. This can be inefficient and difficult to analyze.
Solution: Build a Spring Boot application to centralize gradebook functions and assessment tracking. Features could include:
Flexible grade calculation systems (points, weighted categories, etc.)
Customizable assessment creation (multiple-choice, short-answer, project-based)
Student performance reports with visualizations and comparisons
Integration with Skolon's existing student data
Tech Stack: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA (for database interaction), MySQL/other database, Thymeleaf or a JavaScript front-end framework (React, Vue).
